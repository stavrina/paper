# A first course in git

Authors: Stavrina Dimosthenous, Big TB, Mohammad Eizeddin, John Cena
## Introduction

We are learning how to use Git in the command line today, 2024-10-23.
We are using Gerard Capes' teaching notes for this course - [link here](gcapes.github.io/git-course).

I am finding this quite enjoyable.

## Afternoon impressions

We are in the afternoon hours now. In the northern hemisphere. We just found out they will have to redo their helicopters.
Since we are in the northern hemisphere, it is quite dark, already.
